## What is Junxion?
Junxion is a free desktop application that makes managing all of your blockchain & cryptocurrency assets a breeze. It runs on both Max OSX and Windows. It allows you to load all of your blockchain assets from all of your exchanges and other places, including ERC20 tokens into one locally managed portfolio. For more information and to view the upcoming roadmap visit **[Junxion.io](http://www.junxion.io)**.

## Why Junxion?
The problem with cryptocurrencies today is that there is nothing that allows you to manage all of your assets in one place. A lot of people have assets on several exchanges, some in an ERC20 account and some staking locally or even in offline hardware or paper wallets. So you have to login to several different places in order to manage all of your assets. Junxion fixes that problem by loading your assets into the desktop application and even offers the ability to research and keep track of other up and coming coins. We are adding new features all the time so be sure to check out our **[roadmap](http://www.junxion.io)** to see what is coming.
